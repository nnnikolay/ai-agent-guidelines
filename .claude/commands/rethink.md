description: Question approach and explore alternatives using extended thinking

Please think about this problem thoroughly and in great detail: $ARGUMENTS

Reference the "Quick Decision Guide" in @.claude/guidelines/ai-agent-playbook.md for context.
Consider the principles in @.claude/guidelines/core-rules.md and whether our current approach aligns.

Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.

Specifically explore:
1. What problem are we actually solving? Is it the right problem?
2. What would a radically simpler solution look like?
3. What are we optimizing for? Should we optimize for something else?
4. Should we build this ourselves or use an existing solution?
5. How would we solve this with 10x less code?
6. What are the non-obvious trade-offs of our current approach?

Check if the playbook has alternative patterns we haven't considered.

Challenge the premise, not just the implementation.
Think creatively about completely different approaches.
